I am a first year CS PhD in the [MIT Database Group](http://db.csail.mit.edu/), where I am advised by [Prof. Tim Kraska](http://people.csail.mit.edu/kraska/).
My interests lie broadly in the intersection of systems and machine learning.

In the past, I have worked with [Umar Farooq Minhas](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/ufminhas/) and the [Database Group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/database/) at Microsoft Research on updatable learned index structures.
Prior to MIT, I was an undergraduate at Stanford University, where I worked on data-intensive systems with [Prof. Peter Bailis](http://www.bailis.org) as part of [Stanford DAWN](http://dawn.cs.stanford.edu).
My [CV](/cv.pdf).
